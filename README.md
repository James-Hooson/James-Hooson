# Hi, I'm James 👋

## About Me
I'm a junior developer with six years of security operations experience at Te Herenga Waka Victoria University of Wellington, where I progressed from Foot Patrol to Security Assistant. In my roles, I managed real-time monitoring of 400 CCTV cameras, coordinated security for VIP visits including Prime Ministers Jacinda Ardern and John Key, and managed large scale events with up to 1,400 students. 

I also conducted investigations alongside New Zealand Police and created Standard Operating Procedures that became training materials for the entire security team.
My security background equipped me with exceptional problem solving abilities and experience managing complex systems under pressure.

At Dev Academy Aotearoa, I discovered a passion for building solutions rather than responding to problems. I bring strong collaboration skills, systematic thinking, and the ability to stay calm when debugging production issues or coordinating team efforts. I'm motivated by continuous learning and building applications that make a real impact.
